			<h1>John Lefevre Re-Signed for 2025</h1>
			<p class="article-details"><strong>By Alistair Kirsch-Poole<br>Jan 9, 2024 - 4:30pm</strong></p>
			<p>Old Glory has announced the re-signing of scrumhalf John Lefevre for the 2025 season. The 26-year-old Lorton, Virginia native picked up rugby in high school, where he helped win a National Tier II Championship. After graduating, he played locally for NOVA, earning him a spot in the USA U23 camp and a place on Young Glory. He was promoted to Old Glory in 2022.</p>
<p>Despite showing promise, his time on the pitch was relatively limited with OGDC. In 2022, he played in 7 matches for a total of just 67 minutes played, and in 2023 he played in 12 matches, starting only 1 of them, for a total of just 204 minutes played. While he was a regularly on the matchday rosters, he was never able to mount a proper challenge to the incumbent Danny Tusitala.</p>
<p>In 2024, he opted to join the American Raptors in Super Rugby Americas, presumably for more pplaying time. He had more success there, playing in all 12 of their matches and starting 6 of them. Later that year, with the Raptors' season complete, he returned to Old Glory as a replacement for Tusitala.</p>
<p>The situation he returns to is significantly different to the one he left. Last season, McVeigh and Buckley were able to usurp the throne of Tusitala, locking down the scrumhalf position and prompting the latter's departure. Finding time to play between those two, especially after McVeigh's debut with the Eagles in the offseason, will be a tall task.</p>
<p>Still, Lefevre brings a wide range of talents that should see him not limited to the scrumhalf role. As a successful 7s player, we could see him used on the wing or at fullback, although it's not like the competition there is any less fierce. The local kid has his work cut out for him.</p>

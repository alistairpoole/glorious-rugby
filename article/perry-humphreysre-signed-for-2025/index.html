			<h1>Perry Humphreys Re-Signed for 2025</h1>
			<p class="article-details"><strong>By Alistair Kirsch-Poole<br>Dec 15, 2024 - 8:00pm</strong></p>
			<p>Old Glory has announced that winger Perry Humphreys has been re-signed for the 2025 season. The 30-year-old Englishman first signed for Old Glory last season after stacking up 106 caps over 8 years with the Worcester Warriors. His career in the English Premiership only came to an end due to the sudden collapse of the Warriors in 2022.</p>
<p>Humphreys was one of a trio of seasoned top-level professionals brought in by Simon Cross last season, along with Axel Muller and Damien Hoyland. While he started every match he played in, he was only able to secure 11 caps as intermittent injuries frequently took him out of the lineup. The coaching staff will be hoping to get more out of him next season, as he was in the top five for meters gained and defenders beaten in 2024, and also one of the better open play kickers.</p>
<p>As a seasoned pro, he'll be a favorite to start in as many games as he's healthy for, but there are chances for others to unseat him. John Rizzo has been steadily improving season by season and has the advantage of being a domestic player. There are also some new players who might make a play for some wing minutes, particularly the versatile Jason Emery, draftee Aidan Ridgeway, and young domestic options Kieran Farmer and Declan O'Loughlin. Still it's hard to imagine Humphreys doesn't play a significant role in 2025.</p>

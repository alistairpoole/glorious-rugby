			<h1>Quentin Newcomer Re-Signed for 2025</h1>
			<p class="article-details"><strong>By Alistair Kirsch-Poole<br>Dec 1, 2024 - 3:00pm</strong></p>
			<p>Old Glory has announced the re-signing of loosehead prop Quentin Newcomer. The 28-year-old is a Fairfax, Virginia native who got his professional career started with the New England Free Jacks in 2020. He played 24 matches for them over the course of three seasons, 8 of which were starts.</p>
<p>In 2023 Newcomer returned to join his hometown team in OGDC. He immediately secured a spot on the bench, playing 326 minutes in 15 matches and scoring a try. He reprised that role in 2024, accumulating 327 minutes played in 12 matches, 4 of which saw him in the starting lineup.</p>
<p>Fans should expect similar from him again for the 2025 season. He is unlikely to unseat OGDC's primary starting loosehead of the last few season, Jack Iscaro, especially given the latter's strong campaign with the USA Eagles during the off-season. However, his spot on the bench isn't guaranteed. While he's the first prop to be confirmed for 2025, it seems likely that all of last year's props will return. That would put him in contention with Joe Wrafter and potentially Cali Martinez for those loosehead minutes. While Martinez primarily played tighthead for Old Glory last year, he is capable of playing both sides and played loosehead for the Canadian national team in the offseason. With Kevin Brou back from injury, we could see Martinez spending time on both sides of the scrum next season.</p>
<p>Still, Newcomer comes in as an experienced player entering his sixth year in MLR. He'll be a reliable option for the team as they look to contend for the Shield in 2025.</p>

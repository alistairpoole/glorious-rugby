			<h1>Old Glory DC Makes GMU Their Home Pitch for 2026</h1>
			<p class="article-details"><strong>By Alistair Kirsch-Poole<br>Nov 10, 2025 - 6:00pm</strong></p>
			<p>Old Glory DC has announced that they will play all of their home matches at George Mason University in Fairfax, Virginia. The move has been long-rumored, ever since the team announced that they would be departing their home of the past two season, the Maryland Soccerplex, months ago. OGDC played one match at George Mason last season, although the rain was so heavy that the stands weren't even opened for fans.</p>
<p>The move will have a number of positives. The stadium is significantly closer to DC and the Metro, being just five miles from Vienna/Fairfax station with free CUE busses to the stadium. This will be the most accessible stadium Old Glory has played in since they left Catholic University in 2020.</p>
<p>There should also be improvements to the gameday experience. Tailgating should be allowed in the parking lot, and the team has stated that they intend to bring an expanded beer garden and a "merchants' row" of local vendors.</p>
<p>The field itself has also been praised by several members of the team in conversation, with the players very happy with the quality of the playing surface. The wind should also be signifcantly less of a factor than it was at the Soccerplex, where the high speed gusts caused havoc in the kicking game.</p>
<p>There will be some downsides. The seating is all on one side of the stadium, which doesn't lend itself to the intimate atmosphere that the bowl-like Soccerplex was great for. There's also no hill, which was a hit with families and children. The biggest problem, however, will be the track running around the field, which push the stands about 100 feet away from the sideline. This puts fans much further from the action, a notable negative.</p>
<p>The team has consistently stated their desire to play inside the beltway in the future, even floating the idea of building their own rugby-specific stadium. However, until the situation around the replacement for RFK Stadium settles, there is unlikely to be any movement on such a plan. Paired with the uncertainty in the league right now, any new stadium plan is years away at this point. In the meantime, George Mason should serve as an upgrade over previous stadiums, even if it does leave fans still dreaming about a move to DC someday in the future.</p>

			<h1>John Rizzo Returns for Fifth Season with OGDC </h1>
			<p class="article-details"><strong>By Alistair Kirsch-Poole<br>Dec 12, 2025 - 4:30pm</strong></p>
			<p>Old Glory has announced that winger John Rizzo has been re-signed for the 2026 season. The 27-year-old Midwesterner began playing rugby while attending Indiana University–Purdue University Indianapolis, then moved to DC after college and started playing for the Washington Irish and Capital Selects. Shortly after, he was picked up by Old Glory DC.</p>
<p>Since he was first signed ahead of the 2022 season, his path has been one of linear progression. He played in 5 matches with 1 start for 152 minutes in 2022, then expanded to 8 matches with 3 starts for 334 minutes in 2023, and expanded again to 11 matches with 10 starts for 803 minutes in 2024. Last season, the increase was more slight, 12 matches and 9 starts for 811 minutes.</p>
<p>Next year, though, he will once again have the chance to improve his lot. With Axel Muller no longer on the team, there is a starting spot left open, and Rizzo is primed to fill it. Not that he won't have competition for the role, with the recently signed Harley Wheeler the most obvious contender. Still, there's reason to think Rizzo will come out on top, with his strong defense and familiarity with Coach Cross's system.</p>

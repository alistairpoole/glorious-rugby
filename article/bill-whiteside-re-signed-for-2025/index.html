			<h1>Bill Whiteside Re-Signed for 2025</h1>
			<p class="article-details"><strong>By Alistair Kirsch-Poole<br>Dec 7, 2024 - 4:30pm</strong></p>
			<p>Old Glory has announced that young american lock Billy Whiteside will be returning to the team of the 2025 season. The 25-year-old Californian was a standout player at Lindenwood University before being picked up by Rugby New York in the 2022 MLR draft. He didn't end up making any appearances for the Ironworkers in 2023, but he did tour with the USA Hawks in South America.</p>
<p>Whiteside was picked up by Old Glory after the collapse of the New York team before the 2024 season. Initially he was a signed to a training contract, but that was enough for him to impress the coaches and earn a spot in the regular rotation. He played in 13 matches, 4 of them as a starter, for a total of 354 minutes played.</p>
<p>While that's an impressive contribution for a rookie season, Whiteside will presumably be angling for an expanded role in 2025. His main competition for that will Tevita Naqali, who this season will count as a domestic player, as well as Rob Harley and Ignacio Dotti, assuming they return. Until now Whiteside has had the advantage of being the best of the domestic locks, making his selection easier. Next season, that will be a tougher case given Naqali's new domestic status.</p>
<p>Furthermore, there could be a challenge from players that had a smaller role last season. Logan Weidner was loaned to Anthem last season, but could be returning to Old Glory this season and could push for minutes in the lineup. There's also Charlie Overton, who Old Glory acquired Miami after they took him in last year's draft. He only had a brief appearance last season, but will also want more minutes if he returns.</p>

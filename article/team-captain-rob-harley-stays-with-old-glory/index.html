			<h1>Team Captain Rob Harley Stays with Old Glory</h1>
			<p class="article-details"><strong>By Alistair Kirsch-Poole<br>Dec 17, 2025 - 2:30pm</strong></p>
			<p>Old Glory's captain, veteran Scottish lock Rob Harley, has signed on for the 2026 season. The 35-year-old was one of the key international players brought in by Simon Cross when his tenure began, and he has kept up his end of the bargain.</p>
<p>Born in England, he played his rugby in the Scottish system, making his professional debut for the Glasgow Warriors in 2010. He proceeded to earn 267 caps for the Warriors over the next thirteen years, setting a club record.</p>
<p>He left the Warriors in 2022 to play for US Carcassone in Pro D2, then moved to Colomiers when Carcassone was relegated to Nationale 1. He earned a total of 38 more caps between the those two clubs, putting him over 300 matches of professional rugby before he signed for Old Glory DC in 2024.</p>
<p>He also had a long career internationally, playing in 15 matches for Scotland U20s before being called up to the senior squad in 2012. He would go on to get 23 caps over 9 years, with his last cap coming in 2021.</p>
<p>Harley was one of the big signings for Old Glory in 2024, and he certainly delivered on that promise. He played in 15 matches for the club, 14 of them starts, for a total of 1,175 minutes played. He put in a similar turn last season, with 14 caps, all starts, for 1,069 minutes played. He also took on the captaincy last season, a role he will be expected to continue in the new season.</p>
<p>While eventually age will catch up to him, it's just as likely that it doesn't do so in the 2026 season. While there are strong, domestic competitors at the lock position, it's impossible to replace the vast amount of experience that he brings to the team. Look for him to continue being a regular in the starting lineup next season.</p>

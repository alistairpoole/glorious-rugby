			<h1>Experienced Center Ross Depperschmidt Signs with Old Glory</h1>
			<p class="article-details"><strong>By Alistair Kirsch-Poole<br>Jan 19, 2026 - 4:00pm</strong></p>
			<p>Old Glory has announced the signing of Ross Depperschmidt, an experienced center who previously played for the NOLA Gold. The 33-year-old will be starting his seventh season in Major League Rugby, and his first for a team other than NOLA.</p>
<p>Born in Texas, he played football and baseball in high school before picking up rugby in college at the University of Alabama. He quickly became a force to be reckoned with there, eventually becoming the vice-president of the club. While a graduate student, he trained in New Zealand for a few months and toured with the USA Rugby South Selects in a conscious effort to raise his level, while also coaching at his alma mater.</p>
<p>In 2019 he joined the NOLA Gold academy, playing for them in the offseason and preseason. In 2020, he got his break with the senior squad, playing 2 matches, 1 of them starting for 138 minutes on the pitch. In 2021 he improved that only slightly, with 2 matches, both starts, for 159 minutes played.</p>
<p>It was in 2022 that he got his break, with 12 caps, 6 starts, and 434 minutes on the pitch. He would up that the next two seasons, with 14 caps, 8 starts, and 774 minutes in 2023 and 15 caps, 9 starts, and 790 minutes in 2024. Last season was a bit of a down year for him, though, with just 3 caps and 199 minutes played.</p>
<p>Primarily an outside center, he has also played a fair share of his matches on the wing, making him a flexible option. His biggest competition is likely to be John Powers, who is five years younger but also five years less experienced.</p>

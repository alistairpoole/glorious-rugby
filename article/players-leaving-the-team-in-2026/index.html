			<h1>Players Leaving the Team in 2026</h1>
			<p class="article-details"><strong>By Alistair Kirsch-Poole<br>Oct 22, 2025 - 8:00pm</strong></p>
			<p class="box"><strong>Note:</strong> This article will be updated as departures are announced. This article was last updated on October 26, 2025.</p>
<p>Old Glory has confirmed the departure of several players who were contracted for the 2025 season. None of these players will be returning for 2026 unless circumstances change.</p>
<p>While it has not been publicly announced, Glorious Rugby has learned from multiple credible sources that fan-favorite <strong>Jamason Fa'anana-Schultz</strong> will not be returning to the team. The 29-year-old has been one of the few constants on the team since the inaugural season in 2020, captaining the team in 2023 and 2024 and acting as vice-captain last season. In total he earned 62 caps across 6 seasons with OGDC and scored 12 tries. His loss will be more keenly felt than most by long-time fans of the team.</p>
<p>It is not yet known where he will play his rugby going forward, but sources have indicated that he will be joining another MLR team after they offered him more than Old Glory was prepared to match.</p>
<strong>Martin Vaca</strong>, a young Argentinian hooker who had a successful but injury-filled season in 2024, will not be rejoining the team after he struggled to break into the lineup in 2025. A combination of injury and stiff competition kept him off the team sheet, with just 110 minutes played last season. His future playing plans are unclear, as he doesn't seem to have signed with a new club yet.
<p>In a similar boat is <strong>Ignacio Dotti</strong>, the veteran Uruguayan lock who impressed in lineouts but struggled to get in the lineup with just 315 minutes played. Head coach Simon Cross has expressed before that he expects a lot from foreign players both on the field and in the locker room, and it looks like Vaca and Dotti are the first to go with the increasing restrictions in 2026. He likewise has yet to sign with a new club.</p>
<p>Veteran Eagles center <strong>Tommaso Boni</strong> is a domestic player but is otherwise similar. After being a massive component of the 2024 team, he had difficulty establishing himself on the 2025 squad and played just 308 minutes. With the salary cap rumored to be tightening, coach Cross is likely trying to shift to a younger, cheaper roster. While he has yet to sign with a new club, he has been active with the Eagles in the Pacific Nations Cup.</p>
<p>Argentinian winger <strong>Axel Muller</strong> is a bit different from the above players. While he was born in Argentina and played for their national team back in 2016, he spent a large portion of his childhood in the US and was looking to transfer his international eligibility to the US. His move to MLR was widely seen as part of that, a way to convince World Rugby he was committed to the US. Unfortunately, rules that regularly get stretched for top tier international teams don't tend to for lower tier teams and his transfer was denied.</p>
<p>With all appeal options exhausted, Muller has chosen to return to the French leagues, signing for Nationale 1 team Narbonne. Likely, this move comes down to money, as the tightening purse strings make affording a top-level proven veteran like Muller difficult. He has been a standout player for Old Glory in his two years with the club, racking up 13 tries across 24 starts.</p>
<p>Another big departure from the backs is <strong>Damien Hoyland</strong>. He was a massive boost to the OGDC backline, putting up a huge number of meters gained per carry and beating defenders at an astonishing rate. He will now be joining <a href="https://www.scotsman.com/sport/rugby-union/scottish-rugby-takes-charge-of-gb-sevens-and-reveals-six-new-players-5361197">the rebooted Scotland Mens 7s team</a>, who he played for 2015-16.</p>
<p>Next season will also see the team without the services of scrumhalf <strong>Ethan McVeigh</strong>. The California native was one of two young American players to be brought in two years ago, the other being Connor Buckley. While McVeigh has managed to catch the eye of Eagles head coach Scott Lawrence and earned his first international cap last year, it's Buckley who has become the clear first choice at Old Glory. Multiple sources have stated that McVeigh has chosen to pursue the opportunity to be the first choice scrumhalf elsewhere rather than be the second choice behind Buckley. All accounts suggest that this was an amicable split. It's not yet known where he will play next season.</p>
<p>The only other player confirmed to be departing is a darker story. <strong>Brady Daniel</strong>, the brother of OGDC stalwart Cory Daniel, <a href="https://www.arlnow.com/2025/07/29/professional-rugby-player-charged-with-rape-in-arlington/">was arrested July on charges of rape and sexual assault</a>. The team has announced publicly that they have severed ties him. The 26-year-old had showed promise but never managed to break into the regular rotation, accumulating just 15 caps in four seasons with Old Glory.</p>

			<h1>Joe Wrafter Re-Signed for 2025</h1>
			<p class="article-details"><strong>By Alistair Kirsch-Poole<br>Dec 19, 2024 - 2:30pm</strong></p>
			<p>Old Glory has announced the re-signing of loosehead prop Joe Wrafter. The 28-year-old is English by birth and upbringing but qualifies for the US through his Brooklyn-born grandfather.</p>
<p>Wrafter worked his way up through the English rugby system before he came to DC. He joined Birmingham Mosley in the third tier National League 1 in 2017, before moving up to the second tier RFU Championship to play with Bedford Blues in 2019. During his time there he was also loaned to the Harlequinns in the Premiership, although he wasn't capped at that level. In 2021 he moved to the Doncaster Knights, also in the Championship, before moving again to Hartpury University RFC. His time there was his most successful, earning 15 caps and being named to the Championship team of the season.</p>
<p>Wrafter then joined Old Glory DC for the 2024 season, but was not able to replicate his success. He was used in jsut two matches, both as a reserve, for a total of 32 minutes on the pitch. Whether this was due to injury or simply other players making more of an impression on the coaching staff, it's hard to say.</p>
<p>In 2025, he'll want to expand his role on the team. It won't be easy, though - Jack Iscaro's grip on the starting loosehead position should be as strong as ever, leaving the rest of the props to sort out the pecking order in the reserves. Quentin Newcomer comes in with a strong lead in that department, having played that role last year. There's also a chance that Cali Martinez will play on the loosehead side as well, having done so for the Canadian national team.</p>
<p>With good health and strong performances in practice, though, Wrafter should be able to carve out a spot for himself, especially since the season is long and injuries are a given. Hopefully he'll make the best of the opportunities when they come.</p>

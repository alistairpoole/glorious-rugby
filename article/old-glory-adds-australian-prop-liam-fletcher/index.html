			<h1>Old Glory Adds Australian Prop Liam Fletcher</h1>
			<p class="article-details"><strong>By Alistair Kirsch-Poole<br>Jan 29, 2026 - 3:00pm</strong></p>
			<p>Old Glory DC has announced the acquisition of Liam Fletcher, a loosehead prop who played last season with Chicago, for the 2026 roster. The 26-year-old Australian began his rugby ascent in Queensland, representing various regional age-grade sides before joining the Western Force academy system. He quickly took up a leadership role there, becoming captain of the U20 side and drawing interest from the national u20 team.</p>
<p>In 2020 he signed with Souths Rugby, a club in the semi-professional Queensland Premier Rugby competition. He earned MVP honors in there before switching to Brothers Rugby, a different Queensland Premier club, in 2023. He won back-to-back titles with Brothers Rugby. In 2025 he joined the Chicago Hounds. He was the second choice at loosehead prop there, playing in 13 matches for 324 minutes, all of them off the bench.</p>
<p>He comes in as a bit of an unusual choice for Old Glory. He's the youngest foreign player that the team will have next season by several years, and much less experienced. The foreign players signed for next season are all over 30, veterans with deep wells of experience in the top leagues in the world that they can pass on to a younger cohort of American players. The only exception to that is Cali Martinez, who has years of experience in MLR and is only a foreign player due to the reclassification of Canadians in the offseason.</p>
<p>Martinez is expected to be the starter at loosehead this season, given his role on previous teams and his status as one of the better scrummagers in the league. That will leave Fletcher competing with Vermuelen for a spot on the bench, and his foreign status will make that difficult for him. With only seven foreign player spots to go around, using two just on the loosehead position seems unlikely.</p>

			<h1>Collin Grosse Re-Signed for 2025</h1>
			<p class="article-details"><strong>By Alistair Kirsch-Poole<br>Dec 10, 2024 - 11:00am</strong></p>
			<p>Old Glory has announced the return of Collin Grosse to the 2025 roster. The 25-year-old flanker graduated from West Point in 2022, where he helped the team win a national title alongside teammate KoiKoi Nelligan. He then toured with the USA Falcons before being picked up by OGDC in the 2022 draft.</p>
<p>His rookie season in 2023 started with a bang, as he scored a try less than a minute into his first match. He went on to play all 18 games Old Glory had that season, starting in 11 of them, for a total of 1080 minutes played. In 2024, With Cory Daniel returning from injury, Grosse's role was somewhat reduced to 14 matches played, 7 starts, and 738 minutes played.</p>
<p>That dip from 2023 to 2024 captures the competition that Grosse is facing. At the club level, he has to compete for minutes with a strong trio of back rowers in Jamason Fa'anana-Schultz, Cory Daniel, and Lautaro Bavaro. In the international scene, a combination of injuries and strong competition has meant that while he's been named as a reserve for several tours, he's never been called up to play for the senior Eagles squad.</p>
<p>He'll have further challenge from players deeper in the depth chart as well, with guys like Brady Daniel putting their hands up for more minutes and a cadre of young players coming in through the draft.</p>

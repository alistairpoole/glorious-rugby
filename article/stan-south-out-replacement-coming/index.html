			<h1>Stan South Out, Replacement Coming</h1>
			<p class="article-details"><strong>By Alistair Kirsch-Poole<br>Mar 23, 2023 - 5:58pm</strong></p>
			<p>Old Glory DC GM Marcelo Blanco confirmed on Facebook today that vice-captain Stan South will be out for an extended period due to injury. The lock has been a core part of OGDC the last two seasons, and a particular threat in the lineout. Blanco stated that South will continue with the team as an assistant coach while he recovers.</p>
<p>Blanco also hinted at a replacement for South. While we don't have any clues as to who that will be, the delay in signing has been due to the visa process, implying that the player will not be domestic. While Blanco made no commitment as to when the player would be announced, the fact that he is talking publicly about it implies that we won't have to wait too long.</p>
<p>This isn't the first long-term injury the 26-year-old Englishman has sustained while playing for Old Glory, having missed a significant chunk of the 2021 season as well. While the team hasn't confirmed whether South is expected to recover before the end of the season, the fact that they are considering signing another lock implies that the odds don't look good.</p>
<p>In the meantime, we will likely continue to see a lot of Tevita Naqali and Collin Grosse, two players who have staked a firm claim on the starting spots. While this news is unfortunate, it won't have much effect on the game plan, as South has been out of the lineup for four weeks now.</p>

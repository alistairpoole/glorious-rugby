			<h1>Old Glory DC signs Welsh Hooker Kirby Myhill</h1>
			<p class="article-details"><strong>By Alistair Kirsch-Poole<br>Jan 21, 2026 - 12:00pm</strong></p>
			<p>Old Glory has add veteran Welsh hooker Kirby Myhill to their 2026 roster. The 33-year-old played the last two seasons with the Miami Sharks, who folded during the offseason.</p>
<p>His ascent to being a professional began with the Scarlets Academy U18s before he was promoted to the senior squad in 2010. He would rack up 65 caps with the Scarlets over the course of six seasons in the Pro12, a top-tier league that is now known as the United Rugby Championship (URC). In 2017 he transfered to another Welsh entry in the URC, the Cardiff Blues, adding another 98 caps across his 5 seasons with them.</p>
<p>He also drew interest from the Welsh national team, playing for Wales U16s and U20s in various tournaments. He only earned one international cap, though, in 2021.</p>
<p>In 2024 he came to MLR, joining the Miami Sharks for their inaugural season. He earned 22 caps in two seasons with them, scoring 5 tries along the way.</p>
<p>He comes in to Old Glory as a clear first-choice option given his experience. However, there will be significant competition from the other players on the roster. KoiKoi Nelligan has been a growing force for Old Glory for the last several years and has clearly shown that he has the capacity to handle the starting role. New addition Connor Robinson, similarly, has grown into bigger and bigger roles in MLR and was the primary starter at Anthem for the last two seasons. Both also have the advantage of being domestic players.</p>
<p>Still, even if one or the other does end up taking his spot on the field, Myhill will bring valuable experience and mentorship to the position. This is inline with the pattern evident elsewhere on the roster, of an experienced veteran to anchor the position and the best up-and-coming Americans in the league to learn from them.</p>

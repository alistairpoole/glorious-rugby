			<h1>Old Glory Picks Up Rookie Prop Patrick Beattie </h1>
			<p class="article-details"><strong>By Alistair Kirsch-Poole<br>Dec 16, 2025 - 3:00pm</strong></p>
			<p>Old Glory has added young American rookie Patrick Beattie to the 2026 squad. The 24-year-old California native started playing rugby with the Santa Monica Rugby Club and continued while at Long Beach State University. He extended his playing outside of his college team, touring with the California Grizzlies and playing for amateur clubs in New Zealand and England. He was drafted by RFCLA in the third round of the 2024 MLR Draft, 26th overall, but has yet to make his professional debut.</p>
<p>He is the second confirmed tighthead prop on the team, joining the experienced veteran Paul Mullen. Beattie will almost certainly get his minutes off the bench behind Mullen, as a developmental prospect rather than an immediate starter.</p>
<p>However, there is a complication - Old Glory also picked another tighthead, Connor Devos, in this year's draft. If he is signed by the team, it will create competition for that spot and development minutes for both players. Neither is proven at the MLR level and will need to take a step forward to be ready for the professional game. That's always something of a gamble, as no individual player can ever be relied on to make the jump to a higher level, but in this case Old Glory has an excellent option in Cali Martinez as a backup. While he's expected to primarily play at loosehead, he has already proven himslef as a quality starter on both sides of the scrum and would likely cover the loosehead side if Mullen is unavailable.</p>

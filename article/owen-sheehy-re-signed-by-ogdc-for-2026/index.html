			<h1>Owen Sheehy Re-Signed by OGDC for 2026</h1>
			<p class="article-details"><strong>By Alistair Kirsch-Poole<br>Dec 10, 2025 - 9:00am</strong></p>
			<p>Old Glory DC has announced the return of winger/fullback Owen Sheehy. The 26-year-old Bethesda, Maryland native attended Gonzaga College High School DC and won two national titles with the rugby team there. He then went to the University of Wisconsin, where he was an All-American honorable mention in rugby sevens.</p>
<p>He joined OGDC for the 2021 season, playing in just 3 matches for a total of 43 minutes, but showing promise as a 21-year-old. Later that year he played for the USA Selects in the Americas Pacific Challenge, having previously played for the USA U19 squad in college.</p>
<p>He took on a much bigger role the following season, appearing in 13 matches, 6 of them starts, for a total of 498 minutes played. In 2023, he played in 7 matches, 4 of them starts, for a total of 258 minutes on the pitch.</p>
<p>For the 2024 season, Sheehy opted out of returning to Old Glory and instead decided to spend time in South America. In a conversation before the move, he shared that his motivation was both to gain professional working experience with a company there, but also to participate in Argentina's URBA Top 14. Though an amateur rugby league, the URBA Top 14 is one of the better domestic leagues in the world and has produced multiple OGDC and MLR players in the past.</p>
<p>In 2025 he returned to Old Glory, playing for 453 minutes in 13 appearances, 4 of them starts. He also recorded a career high of four tries, having only scored one previously.</p>
<p>He will face more of a challenge seeing the field in 2026, though. While a versatile back who can play multiple positions, he'll face stiff competition at all of them. On the wing, Harley Wheeler will be joining the team, and he will want to regain the form that won him the top award in college rugby. At fullback, where Sheehy played most of his minutes last season, there's now the specter of Max Schumacher, the up-and-coming star who started for Houston in the MLR finals at fullback. There may also be more players yet to be announced who could make the prospects event tougher. Still, Sheehy has the talent to compete if he can reach his full potential.</p>

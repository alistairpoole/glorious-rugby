			<h1>Perry Humphreys Re-Signs with Old Glory</h1>
			<p class="article-details"><strong>By Alistair Kirsch-Poole<br>Nov 26, 2025 - 1:30pm</strong></p>
			<p>Old Glory DC has aannounced the return of experienced English winger Perry Humphreys. The 31-year-old was one of a number of high-end professionals brought in by Simon Cross in his first season. He had 106 caps over 8 years with the Worcester Warriors in the English Premiership, which only came to an end due to the sudden collapse of the Warriors in 2022.</p>
<p>While he has started every match he has played in, he was only able to manage 11 caps in 2024 and 12 caps in 2025 due to intermittent injuries and foreign player limitations. Despite that, he was able to raack up 7 tries last season.</p>
<p>With the departure of Axel Muller and questions around the availability of Damien Hoyland, Humphreys will likely be expected to take on a bigger role in 2026. We don't yet know who else will be in the back three, but based on Simon Cross's strategy at other positions, we can expect that Humphreys will start alongside another top level player, likely John Rizzo, with up and coming American players competing for time on the bench in the back three.</p>
<p>Coach Cross has stated in the past that he sees Humphreys as one of the best backs on the team and sees particular value in what he can teach young domestic players with respect to positioning on the field and the kicking game.</p>

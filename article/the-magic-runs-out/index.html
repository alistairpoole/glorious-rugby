			<h1>The Magic Runs Out</h1>
			<p class="article-details"><strong>By Jack Foster<br>Mar 18, 2025 - 6:00pm</strong></p>
			<p>Despite another furious comeback effort, Old Glory DC fell just short against the Chicago Hounds in round 5 of Major League Rugby, falling to 2-2 on 12 table points. In an unusual finish, DC becomes the first losing team this season to secure a try bonus point while the winner did not.</p>
<p>Although Old Glory had been among the most disciplined teams in MLR in the opening rounds, having not received a card until round 4, DC committed 13 penalties in the first half and 18 total. Loosehead prop Jack Iscaro and No. 8 Lautaro Bavaro each received yellow cards, the third and fourth in the past two rounds for DC. The penalties gave Chicago repeated opportunities to advance on Old Glory territory, and the Hounds put up 20 first-half points as a result, including a penalty try in the 27th minute.</p>
<p>DC winger Perry Humphreys gave Old Glory a brief lead with a try in the 12th minute as DC worked quickly to the right side off of a scrum. Center Nick Grigg motored up to the 10-meter line and Humphrey dove into the right corner after three quick passes. The try was Humphreys’ first of the season and of a hat trick in this game.</p>
<p>Humphreys scored his second try in the 58th minute as Old Glory, with the wind at their backs, returned to the quick passing and creative play which served them well in previous games. Energized by the much-needed score, DC powered their way up the field again with a line break from fullback Damien Hoyland. Although hooker KoiKoi Nelligan dropped the ball during the ensuing phase, center Steff Hughes kicked it through the Chicago line for flanker Cory Daniel to dot down, making the score 23-19 in the 62nd minute.</p>
<p>Not to be outdone, Chicago flanker MacLean Jones scored just two minutes later to restore the Hounds’ lead to 11 points. The former NSW Waratah leads Chicago and is tied for second in the league with four tries.</p>
<p>Humphreys finished his hat trick in the 74th minute after Old Glory stole a Chicago lineout. DC first worked three phases toward the left side of the field, then strung passes all the way to the right for Humphreys to touch down in the corner, making the score 30-26.</p>
<p>Old Glory held possession from the 77th minute onward, working their way up the pitch with phases. No. 8 Collin Grosse broke through the Hounds’ line at the 78th minute to bring DC within the Chicago 22-meter line. However, just as the clock passed 80 minutes, flyhalf Jason Robertson knocked on a pass to seal Old Glory’s fate.</p>
<p>Chicago and DC now sit first and second respectively in the Eastern Conference. The Hounds will go on a bye week while Old Glory will return home to face the New England Free Jacks, who sit one point behind DC in the standings. That game will kickoff Saturday at 5 pm.</p>

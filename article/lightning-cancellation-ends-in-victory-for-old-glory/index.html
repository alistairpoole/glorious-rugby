			<h1>Lightning Cancellation Ends in Victory for Old Glory</h1>
			<p class="article-details"><strong>By Alistair Kirsch-Poole<br>May 7, 2023 - 10:32am</strong></p>
			<p>Old Glory has come away with their first road win of the season, albeit in unusual circumstances. After a defensive slog of a first half, lightning strikes around the stadium put the game on hold. As the delay stretched longer, the decision was made to cancel the remainder of the match. MLR policy in such situations dictates that, provided the first half of the match is complete, the score at the time of cancellation is taken as a the final score.</p>
<p>The match started unfavorably for Old Glory with a number of errors. The excessive lines on the field caused confusion and the some penalties led to Dallas having the first opportunity at points with a penalty kick. They took it to grab a 3-0 lead in the first five minutes of the match.</p>
<p>As the match went on, though, it was Old Glory that seemed to be in control of affairs. They pressed significantly in Jackal territory, but struggled to convert their possession into points. A first try was called off for obstruction, and several other opportunities went wanting due to handling errors.</p>
<p>A yellow card to Langilangi Haupeakui gave fans reason for concern, but Dallas was unable to capitalize on his absence. Instead, shortly after his return to the pitch, Willie Talataina was able to cut through close to the goal line to score Old Glory's long awaited try. It came just before half time, with the conversion kick sailing over as the last play of the half.</p>
<p>With lightning strikes getting very close to the stadium, the match was called off at half time. Neither team will be happy with that result: Dallas will have been feeling like they had a real shot after a strong defensive showing, while OGDC will have wanted to secure a bonus to put them farther ahead in the tight Eastern Conference standings. In the end, though, a win is a win, and Old Glory levels their record at 5-5.</p>

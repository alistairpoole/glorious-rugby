			<h1>Steff Hughes Moves to Coaching Role for 2026</h1>
			<p class="article-details"><strong>By Alistair Kirsch-Poole<br>Nov 14, 2025 - 9:00am</strong></p>
			<p>Old Glory has announced that Welsh center Steff Hughes will transition from being a player/coach to purely a coaching role in 2026. He will be filling the role of Attack and Backs coach, which was left vacant by the departure of Kurt Baker earlier this offseason. During the offseason, Hughes has been coaching one of the three Young Glory regional academy teams.</p>
<p>He was essential as a player to the improved attack the team saw last season, opening up space for the wingers with great running lines and deft ball handling. Now he will try to improve the attack just through coaching the players on the field.</p>
<p>His elevation to a coaching role does leave a large gap to fill in the back line. His 15 starts in 15 matches for 1,127 minutes played made him one of the most heavily used players on the team, and his style of play was very impactful on the team. With no centers currently announced for the 2026 roster, it's unclear whether the team will be trying to elevate a player like John Powers to the starting lineup or bring in an experienced hand from outside.</p>

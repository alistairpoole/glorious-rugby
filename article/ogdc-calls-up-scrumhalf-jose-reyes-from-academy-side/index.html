			<h1>OGDC Calls up Scrumhalf Jose Reyes from Academy Side</h1>
			<p class="article-details"><strong>By Alistair Kirsch-Poole<br>Feb 9, 2023 - 11:15pm</strong></p>
			<p>Old Glory has called up scrumhalf Jose Reyes to the senior squad. The University of Mary Washington product has been playing with Young Glory, Old Glory's u23 academy side. He is just the latest in a steady stream of players to come out of OGDC's youth program. Originally from Woodbridge, Virginia, he is a true, longtime local.</p>
<p>I was critical of Old Glory's lack of scrumhalves in my position preview (they only had two at the time), but now Reyes is second new scrumhalf to be signed in the last week. We saw the other one, Gardy Lebon, make a significant impression in last Friday's match. Reyes is set to come off the bench this weekend against Toronto.</p>
<p>Reyes will be seeing some familiar names on the senior squad, as a number of his Young Glory teammates have been called up over the years. Cory Daniel, John Rizzo, John Lefevre, Owen Sheehy, and Alex Balladares have all made the jump before him.</p>
<p>How much time Reyes actually gets on the pitch remains to be seen. He will have plenty of competition at scrumhalf, with Danny Tusitala guaranteed to start, John Lefevre having an extra year as a professional, and Lebon impressing last week. We may see him debut on the wings, as it's a position where he can get used to the level of play without causing too much damage. We've seen that strategy employed for a number of rookie backs.</p>
<p>With the season starting in just over a week, Old Glory is continuing to fill out the roster. I don't expect any more new signings, but the way things are going, who know?</p>

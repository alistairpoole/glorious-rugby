			<h1>Martin Vaca Re-Signed for 2025</h1>
			<p class="article-details"><strong>By Alistair Kirsch-Poole<br>Dec 3, 2024 - 2:00pm</strong></p>
			<p>Old Glory DC has announced that Argentine hooker Martin Vaca will be returning for a second season with the club. Despite being only 23 years old, Vaca already has a wealth of professional rugby experience. He made his pro debut with Jaguares XV, at the time the only Argentine team in Super Rugby Americas, in 2021. Hist strong play earned him a contract in France, where he played for two years with Narbonne.</p>
<p>In 2024 he joined Old Glory, and the move can only be described as a huge success. He played in 11 matches, 8 of which he started, for a total of 682 minutes played. He was sensational with ball in hand, scoring five tries and gaining over 300 meters. Niggling injuries were the only thing to slow him down, with only four appearances in second half of the season.</p>
<p>With his top-tier play, it seems unlikely that he won't be given first crack at the 2 jersey when the season rolls around. He will have to fend off challenges for that spot, particularly from the up and coming KoiKoi Nelligan, but assuming he brings the same skill and spirit, it's hard to see anyone but him starting for OGDC.</p>

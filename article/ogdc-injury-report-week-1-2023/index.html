			<h1>OGDC Injury Report - Week 1, 2023</h1>
			<p class="article-details"><strong>By Alistair Kirsch-Poole<br>Feb 17, 2023 - 12:00pm</strong></p>
			<p>Once again this year, I will be trying to keep an up-to-date record of who is and is not injured. This is made significantly more difficult by the tendency of MLR teams to be tight-lipped about things like that, presumably in some excessive attempt to hobble their opponents' scouting reports.</p>
<p>For week one, Old Glory is fortunately looking very healthy. The only confirmed player out is John Lefevre, although there are other players who may not be 100%. Junior Sa'u and Thretton Palamo both had minor injuries that prevented them playing in the first preseason match, but I'm counting both as healthy since they played in the most recent match against Toronto.</p>
<p>Ramiro Herrera has apparently landed in the US and is just finishing up paperwork before he joins the team DC. Whether he will be available for Saturday's match is unclear, and even if he is he might not play due to the limited time he will have had in practice.</p>

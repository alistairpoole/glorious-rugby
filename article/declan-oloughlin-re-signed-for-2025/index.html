			<h1>Declan O'Loughlin Re-Signed for 2025</h1>
			<p class="article-details"><strong>By Alistair Kirsch-Poole<br>Dec 10, 2024 - 2:30pm</strong></p>
			<p>Old Glory has re-signed utility back Declan O'Loughlin for the 2025 season. The 22-year-old Irishman was signed to a training contract in 2024, but isn't well known amoung Old Glory fans as he did not take the field.</p>
<p>O'Loughlin began his rugby career in Ireland, playing for Corinthians and Connacht Academy sides until he moved to the United States to play for Mount St Mary's. Since then, he has played for Rocky Gorge and for Young Glory, before being signed to a training contract for Old Glory.</p>
<p>Despite being untested at a professional level, his potential is clear. Having played rugby since he was young, he has an inherent leg up on players who only picked up the game in college, and he was also successful in school as a sprinter, a skill which could serve him well in the backs. Whether we'll see him on the field this season or not, the coaches clearly think he's got upside and want to see him develop.</p>

			<h1>Jason Robertson Re-Signed for 2025</h1>
			<p class="article-details"><strong>By Alistair Kirsch-Poole<br>Dec 14, 2024 - 3:30pm</strong></p>
			<p>Old Glory has announced the return of Jason Robertson for the 2025 season. The 30-year-old Zimbabwe-born, New Zealand-raised flyhalf has been the primary starter at his position for three of Old Glory's five seasons and hardly needs an introduction for fans.</p>
<p>He made his pro debut in 2016 with Waikato in New Zealand's National Provincial Championship, then spent a season with Tokyo Gas in Japan's Top East League before returning to the NPC with Bay of Plenty. His first big success came when he joined Old Glory DC in 2020, though. He started every game of the pandemic-shortened 2020 season and only missed out on a couple of matches due to injury in 2021.</p>
<p>His league-leading play during these years earned him a contract in the Pro D2 in France, where he played for a season with Narbonne. A convincing season there earned him a spot with Bayonne in the Top 14 in 2023. He wasn't able to properly break into the roation there, though, and moved back to Old Glory DC in 2024.</p>
<p>Fortunately, his move back has been incredibly successful. He played in all 17 matches for Old Glory in 2024, starting all but 2, for a total 1,226 minutes on the pitch, all of which are career highs. He also set a career high for points scored with 138 on the season, which is the 7th most points scored in a season in MLR history.</p>
<p>To say that Robertson is the favorite for the #10 jersey next season would be an understatement, but it will be interesting to see if any other players get a look in. Gradyn Bowd is the most likely other player to get some time at the position, assuming he returns, but there are also some other interesting options. Jason Emery is joining the team, and while he is most likely going to be used in the centers and back three, he has also played at flyhalf before. There's also draftee Aidan Ridgeway and the rumored signing of Kieran Farmer, both of whom are young US-qualified options who have played at flyhalf in the past.</p>
<p>Still, short of injury Robertson looks like the first choice at flyhalf, and the team is better for it.</p>

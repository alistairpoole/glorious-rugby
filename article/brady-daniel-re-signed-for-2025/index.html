			<h1>Brady Daniel Re-Signed for 2025</h1>
			<p class="article-details"><strong>By Alistair Kirsch-Poole<br>Dec 10, 2024 - 2:00pm</strong></p>
			<p>Old Glory has re-signed flanker Brady Daniel for 2025. The 25-year-old is original from Silver Spring, and like his older brother Cory Daniel was a multiple sport athlete in high school and college. Unlike his borther, one of those sports was rugby. After graduating college he joined the Colorado XO Raptors, a rugby team comprised primarily of crossover athletes, before signing on with Old Glory in 2022.</p>
<p>His time at Old Glory has seen him steadily increase his playing time. In 2022, he played in just 1 match for 7 minutes. In 2023, he expanded that to 5 matches played, 3 starts, for 189 minutes in total. Last season, he played in 9 matches, 2 of them starts, for a total of 238 minutes.</p>
<p>However, expanding his role will be a challenge. The back row is one of the most competitive positions for Old Glory, with plenty of strong players vying for spots on the roster. With a couple of back row players picked in the draft as well, Brady Daniel will have to prove himself worthy of more minutes.</p>
<p>Working in his favor is a dynamic style of play that makes him notable off the bench. Multiple times last season he had a positive impact as a sub, bringing momentum-shifting energy. If he can channel more of that in 2025, he should be able to find a spot on the matchday rosters.</p>

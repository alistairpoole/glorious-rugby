			<h1>Talismanic Flyhalf Jason Robertson Re-Signs for 2026</h1>
			<p class="article-details"><strong>By Alistair Kirsch-Poole<br>Nov 17, 2025 - 5:00pm</strong></p>
			<p>Old Glory DC has announced the re-signing of Jason Robertson, the team's first-choice in the 10 jersey for four of the team's six season. After his 2025 season saw him relegated to the sidelines with injury, he will be eager to return the pitch in 2026.</p>
<p>He made his pro debut in 2016 with Waikato in New Zealand's National Provincial Championship, then spent a season with Tokyo Gas in Japan's Top East League before returning to the NPC with Bay of Plenty. His first big success came when he joined Old Glory DC in 2020. He started every game of the pandemic-shortened 2020 season and only missed out on a couple of matches due to injury in 2021.</p>
<p>His league-leading play during these years earned him a contract in the Pro D2 in France, where he played for a season with Narbonne. A convincing season there earned him a spot with Bayonne in the Top 14 in 2023. He wasn't able to properly break into the roation there, though, and moved back to Old Glory DC in 2024.</p>
<p>Fortunately, his move back has been incredibly successful. He played in all 17 matches for Old Glory in 2024, starting all but 2, for a total 1,226 minutes on the pitch, all of which are career highs. He also set a career high for points scored with 138 on the season, which is the 7th most points scored in a season in MLR history. He suffered a setback in 2025, getting hit with a serious leg injury after starting the first 7 matches of the season.</p>
<p>In 2026, he seems set to retake the reins of the team. Jason Emery, who covered the flyhalf position in Robertson's absence, will likely return to his normal position of inside center. However, an interesting wrinkle this season is the signing of young American Max Schumacher, who has played mostly at fullback but is projected to move to flyhalf in the long term. While unlikely to challenge Robertson for the starting flyhalf position this season, he could well be in line to inherit the throne in years to come.</p>

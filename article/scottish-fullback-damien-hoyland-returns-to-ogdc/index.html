			<h1>Scottish Fullback Damien Hoyland Returns to OGDC</h1>
			<p class="article-details"><strong>By Alistair Kirsch-Poole<br>Dec 1, 2025 - 10:30am</strong></p>
			<p>Star fullback Damien Hoyland has been re-signed by Old Glory DC for the 2026 season. It was previously reported that he would be departing the team, given that he will be joining <a href="https://www.scotsman.com/sport/rugby-union/scottish-rugby-takes-charge-of-gb-sevens-and-reveals-six-new-players-5361197">the rebooted Scotland Mens 7s team</a>. However, this will not prevent him playing for Old Glory in 2026. How exactly this arrangement will work out is not clear, especially as <a href="https://scottishrugby.org/news-and-features/annual-report-2024-25-scottish-rugby-on-track-to-meet-financial-targets/#:~:text=Scottish%20Rugby%20also%20disposed%20of%20its%20interest%20in%20%E2%80%98Old%20Glory%E2%80%99%20(Washington%20DC%20professional%20team)">the Scottish Rugby Union has sold their ownership stake in the team</a>. His return is welcome news to OGDC fans though, who have enjoyed his spectacular carrying from deep for the last two seasons.</p>
<p>Hoyland was involved with rugby early, representing Edinburgh and Scotland at successive age grade levels until he made his senior debut in 2014. He proceeded to play for Edinburgh for the next nine seasons, earning 105 caps and scoring 26 tries. He has also played internationally for Scotland, with 6 total test caps.</p>
<p>His first season with OGDC was a huge success. He led the team with 1,014 meters gained in 2024, good for over 9 meters per carry. He was a difficult man for opposing defenses to bring down, with his average of 3.73 defenders beaten per match one of the best in the league. He continued that form this past season, gaining 1,073 meters and scoring a try.</p>
<p>Going into 2026, Hoyland will be the favorite to start in the 15 jersey, but he will face some competition. Young American Max Schumacher, who started for Houston in last year's championship match, will be pushing for playing time. Still, Hoyland's electric form over the past couple seasons will make him a tough starter to unseat.</p>

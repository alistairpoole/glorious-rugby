			<h1>About Glorious Rugby</h1>

			<p>The site was founded by Alistair Kirsch-Poole in late 2019, starting up just before Old Glory DC's inaugural MLR season. In the intervening years, the site has gone through numerous trials, including two sudden failures of the webhosting companies keeping the site online. The current iteration of the site has been up since January 2024, although it has as much of the content from earlier iterations as could be salvaged from the wreckage of those sites.</p>
<p>In January 2023, Glorious Rugby teamed up with John Fitzpatrick of the excellent Rugby Morning newletter to bring you the Glorious Rugby Podcast. Now a year in and with over 50 episodes, the world's only active Old Glory podcast has been a well-recieved addition to the OGDC fanbase.</p>

			<h1>Back Three - 2025 Position Previews </h1>
			<p class="article-details"><strong>By Alistair Kirsch-Poole<br>Feb 6, 2025 - 5:15pm</strong></p>
			<p>We wrap up our position previews with the back three, the wings and the fullback. This was a position that saw a lot of attention and big signings last offseason, with the introduction of experienced professionals from overseas in Axel Müller, Perry Humphreys, and Damien Hoyland. This year it remains largely unchanged as Simon Cross has focused on other areas of the roster.</p>
<p>Last season we saw huge potential from many of the players, but there were also some things lacking. Defensively, the team had a tendency to give up territory on the edge, while on attack they struggled to find space. A lot of these things should be helped by new experienced options in the centers, who will take some of the pressure off in defense and open up space in attack. The question, then, will be how well the back three can take advantage of that.</p>
<p>For this guide, I've divided the players are divided into four categories:</p>
	<ul>
		<li><strong>Starters</strong> - proven top-level talent who will be expected to be in rotation of players starting most matches</li>
		<li><strong>Challengers</strong> - players who have experience but will have take a step forward to break into the starting rotation</li>
		<li><strong>Projects</strong> - players who are inexperienced at a professional level and whose playing time this season will be limited unless they take a big step forward</li>
		<li><strong>Cover</strong> - other players who can play the position if needed</li>
	</ul>

<p>Returning on the wings are the three standouts from last season. Argentine 7s and 15s international Axel Müller provides an unparalled ability to break tackles and beat defenders, and he scored an impressive five tries in eleven appearances last season. Perry Humphreys, an English player with Premiership experience, brings a more calm and collected approach to the position. Young American John Rizzo, meanwhile, quietly had an amazing season last year with the second highest dominant tackle rate in the league and gained more meters per carry than most of his teammates. All three should make for a solid rotation of wings.</p>
<p>The prime challenger to that rotation is Owen Sheehy. While he primarily projects as a fullback, he will likely want to get time wherever he can in the back line. He was a core part of earlier OGDC teams and hopefully has expanded his game after a sojourn in Argentina.</p>
<p>Cover for the wing can be found across the back line, as most backs are capable of playing the position well enough in a pinch and many young players get their debut there. However, there are a couple of players more likely than the other to be used. John Lefevre, as an accomplished sevens player, has the speed and slipperiness to cover the position well, and may be forcced out there if he can't break the McVeigh/Buckley duopoly at scrumhalf. Jason Emery, meanwhile, can play anywhere in the lineup and would be a reliable option if necessary.</p>
<p>There are a couple players leaving the position. Ishmail Shabazz was a surprisingly big contributor to the team last season, playing almost 400 minutes and looking pretty good while doing so. The coaching staff wanted to bring him back, but life circumstances made it infeasible. Palema Roberts is also departing, having returned to the team last season after two years out with injury.</p>

<p>Damien Hoyland returns as the first choice at fullback. The Scottish international quickly made an impression last year, and despite being out for large chunks of last season he still ended up in the top 10 players for meters gained last season. He is an incredibly dynamic runner and should be exciting again this season.</p>
<p>The primary challenger for the position, as with the wings, is Owen Sheehy. While unseating Hoyland will be a tall task, Sheehy brings a promising combination of speed and vision of the broader game that could make him a valuable asset.</p>
<p>Cover for the position is most likely to come from, you guessed it, Jason Emery, whose flexibility around the pitch makes him an easy choice to cover fullback. Jason Robertson could also play some time at 15 as many of the skills and responsibilties overlap with the flyhalf role, although it definitely isn't his best position. We could also see Perry Humphreys step in if required, something he did a surprising amount last year to cover injuries.</p>
<p>A notable departure from the fullback position is Mike Dabulas. Previously a star for Old Glory, injury troubles disrupted his career and he was not a significant part of last year's team on the pitch.</p>

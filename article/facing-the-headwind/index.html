			<h1>Facing the Headwind</h1>
			<p class="article-details"><strong>By Jack Foster<br>Mar 6, 2025 - 12:00pm</strong></p>
			<p>A blistering wind ripped across the Maryland Soccerplex as Old Glory DC faltered in their home opener, falling to the San Diego Legion 26-10. Having come off a bye week in round 2, Old Glory falls to 1-1 and sits at fourth place in the Eastern Conference on five table points.</p>
<p>The Legion broke a scoreless deadlock at the 16th minute. After a lineout from 20 meters out, San Diego mauled for 15 meters before working around the DC defense for winger James Vaifale to dot the ball down in the left hand corner for the early lead.</p>
<p>Penalties played an enormous role in this game and proved costly for both sides all day. San Diego advanced to the DC goal line at the 10th minute but were penalized for an illegal ruck, allowing DC to release the pressure. San Diego’s first try was partially set up by a penalty against DC for not rolling away from the ruck, allowing the Legion a free kick into the DC 22-meter line. The final penalty count was 15 against San Diego with just seven against Old Glory. Although San Diego suffered more than twice as many penalties, the timing of DC’s penalties significantly cut off their momentum.</p>
<p>San Diego tacked on a second try in the 33rd minute when flanker Brad Wilkin slipped through the DC line to score on a breakaway. The try was Wilkin's first of the 2025 season and gave the Legion a 12-3 lead heading into halftime.</p>
<p>Facing the wind in the second half, Old Glory elected to kick as little as possible, opting instead opting instead to run with the ball in hand to gain nearly all of their meter. As a result, DC outgained San Diego in ground meters 396 to 243. The 243 meters for San Diego is the lowest for a team with a bonus-point win in MLR history. By contrast, the Legion used the second-half tailwind to their advantage, kicking for a total of 459 meters to Old Glory’s 136.</p>
<p>A controversial incident occurred in the 50th minute when San Diego center Tiaan Loots tackled DC flyhalf Jason Robertson without the ball, causing a brief wrestling match as tempers flared. Although several fans clamored for Loots to receive a red card for a cynical tackle, he escaped with a basic penalty against the Legion.</p>
<p>Old Glory finally reached the try line when fullback Owen Sheehy broke through the San Diego Line off of a scrum to dot down under the posts for an automatic seven points. It was Sheehy’s first MLR try since his previous stint with Old Glory in 2023. Though that score brought DC’s deficit to nine points at 19-10, it was the last score Old Glory would manage. San Diego scored one final try in the 74th minute to remain undefeated and hand Old Glory their first loss of the season.</p>
<p>Old Glory will remain at home in round four to face Anthem Rugby Carolina on Saturday at 3 p.m. The Legion return home for a California clash with RFC Los Angeles on Saturday at 10 p.m.</p>
